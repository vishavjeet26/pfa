Guidelines to solve the problems -:
1. Please write unit test cases using pytest.
2. Write production level code, python project structure, makefile and use flake-8 etc .
3. Share the github link as solution 




Problem 1

Write method to merge 2 csv files with different column header and write the output to another csv with headers from all the csv's files.


import csv

def csv_merge(list_of_csv_file, output_path):

Problem 2 

Write a method to compress all file in a folder with specified extensions and save to output path.
Please write unit test cases using pytest.
Write production level code and project structure  


import os
from zipfile import ZipFile

def zip_files(search_directory, selected_extensions, output_path):
	# TODO
    
                    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    zip_files('.\\my_stuff', ['.jpg','.txt'], 'my_stuff.zip')
